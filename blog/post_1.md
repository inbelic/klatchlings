## Sad startings
After having my entire codebase getting corrupted once because my entire Ubuntu
partition was corrupted. And having it wiped again as I was transferring the
codebase from my Manjaro distribution to Windows partition through a usb...
I will create this now and push regularly since Ubuntut can now use my wifi
drivers again...

## The essence of iterative development
Given that I enjoy working in an iterative style, it only fits that I am now
starting from scratch the 3rd time on this project. I "lost" maybe 50+ hours now
of work in my corrupted attempts. However, I didn't lose the knowledge gained
which is indeed the essence of an iterative style.

This iteration will hopefully be the cleanest and best. Although my previous one
was looking to be on a great track.

## I enjoy Haskell but...
Rewriting the same code for the nth time is a bit tedious. Previous iterations
I had wanted to complete this part first before continuing to the C/C++ and
Erlang components. However, to take a break from the head-banging I will work
on the other components as well. Although progress here will be a bit shaky as
I have not used SFML for a while...

## Anyways
I will force myself to write more frequently if I find time between work and
classes to get this project going again. I need somewhere to vent a little
though so this will be a good place. If you didn't know yet, my project got
corrupted twice! I have successfully passed the first stages of grief but now
that depression gets to sink in. But as wise Swedish men say, det är så det är
o det ska bli hur det ska bli :p.

Hopefully, one I get past this stage of grief the blog content will be less
emotionally charged and good grade A content.
